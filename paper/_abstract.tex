In this paper, a possible solution for the Cityscapes Pixel-Level Segmentation task is discussed.
The U-Net architecture is taken as a baseline. Various improvements from literature are tested to improve the baseline score. The results are summarized in figures an images from the training process. This yields a final intersection-over-union-score of 0.84 on a downscaled version of the dataset. The results were not submitted to the testing suite, because the dataset was scaled down too much in order to be workable on the available hardware.
