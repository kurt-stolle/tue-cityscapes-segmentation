The Cityscapes Dataset involves a large number of pictures taken from the front of a car while driving through various cities in Germany \cite{Cordts2016Cityscapes}.

In this paper, a practical solution to the pixel-level semantic labeling task is discussed.
This involves predicting a per-pixel semantic labeling of the image without consiering higher-level object instance or boundary information.

First, a baseline is set using an off-the-shelf architecture for semantic segmentation.
This baseline network is then improved by data augmentation and iterative design, after which this solution is tested.
The results of testing are finally interpreted and discussed.
