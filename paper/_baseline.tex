The baseline implementation sets a reference point to improve upon and score our method against.

The architecture U-Net is suitable for semantic segmentation~\cite{RonnebergerFB15}.
It can be used as an off-the-shelf network for performing the task.

Our implementation of the UNet is based on~\cite{GH-Pytorch-UNet2018} with some modifications to run on the target system and handle the input files.
